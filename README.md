## Kinect Exercise Detection


An application that anaylzes user's form when performing a squat and bench press. My application uses the microsoft Kinect to calculate the difference in the movements of various joints. Therefore, I could see the ratio and determine what is an incorrect form and what is correct.

In order to do so I used the modules pykinect2 and pygame.

This link helped me install pygame and pykinect2.
Go to the Pre-workshop installation guide and follow the steps to downloading the modules.
The details steps are on the powerpoint.

In order to run this project, you need to have the kinect fully functional and connected to the computer. Then, you simply need to run the python code in a shell (visual studios etc).
